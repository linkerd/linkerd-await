## Examples

### Dockerfile

The `linkerd-await` container image contains only a static binary, so it's
possible to use this utility in `scratch` images:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
# ...
COPY --from=olix0r/linkerd-await:v0.1.0 /linkerd-await /
ENTRYPOINT ["/linkerd-await", "--"]
CMD ["/myapp", "-flags"]
```
