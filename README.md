# linkerd-await

A command-wrapper that polls Linkerd for readiness until it becomes ready and only then executes a command.

## Usage

```
linkerd-await 0.2.1
Wait for linkerd to become ready before running a program

USAGE:
    linkerd-await [OPTIONS] [CMD]...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -S, --shutdown    Forks the program and triggers proxy shutdown on completion
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --backoff <backoff>    Time to wait after a failed readiness check [default: 1s]
    -p, --port <port>          The port of the local Linkerd proxy admin server [default: 4191]

ARGS:
    <CMD>...
```

## Examples

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Create a base layer with linkerd-await froma recent release.
FROM docker.io/curlimages/curl:latest as linkerd
ARG LINKERD_AWAIT_VERSION=v0.2.1
RUN curl -sSLo /tmp/linkerd-await https://github.com/olix0r/linkerd-await/releases/download/release%2F${LINKERD_AWAIT_VERSION}/linkerd-await-${LINKERD_AWAIT_VERSION}-amd64
RUN chmod 755 /tmp/linkerd-await

# Build your application with whatever environment makes sense.
FROM myapp-build as app
WORKDIR /app
RUN make build

# Package the application wrapped by linkerd-await. Note that the binary is
# static so it can be used on `scratch` images:
FROM scratch
COPY --from=linkerd /tmp/linkerd-await /linkerd-await
COPY --from=app /app/myapp /myapp
# In this case, we configure the proxy to be shutdown after `myapp` completes
# running. This is only really needed for jobs where the application is
# expected to complete on its own (namely, `Jobs` and `Cronjobs`)
ENTRYPOINT ["/linkerd-await", "--shutdown" "--"]
CMD  ["/myapp"]
```

### Disabling `linkerd-await` at runtime

Note that the `LINKERD_DISABLED` flag can be set to bypass `linkerd-await`'s
readiness checks. This way, `linkerd-await` may be controlled by overriding a
default environment variable:

```yaml
    # ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          env:
            - name: LINKERD_DISABLED
              value: "Linkerd is disabled ;("
          # ...
```
