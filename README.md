# linkerd-await

A command-wrapper that polls Linkerd for readiness until it becomes ready and only then executes a command.

## Usage

```
linkerd-await 0.1.2
Oliver Gould <ver@buoyant.io>
Wait for linkerd to become ready before running a program.

USAGE:
    linkerd-await [OPTIONS] [CMD]...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --backoff <backoff>     [default: 1s]
    -u, --uri <uri>             [default: http://127.0.0.1:4191/ready]

ARGS:
    <CMD>...
```

## Examples

### Dockerfile

The `linkerd-await` container image contains only a static binary, so it's
possible to use this utility in `scratch` images:

```dockerfile
ARG LINKERD_AWAIT_VERSION=v0.1.2

FROM scratch
RUN curl -vsLO https://github.com/olix0r/linkerd-await/releases/download/${LINKERD_AWAIT_VERSION}/linkerd-await
# ... install myapp ..
ENTRYPOINT ["/linkerd-await", "--"]
CMD ["/myapp", "-flags"]
```

Note that the `LINKERD_DISABLED` flag can be set to bypass `linkerd-await`'s
readiness checks. This way, `linkerd-await` may be controlled by overriding a
default environment variable:

```yaml
    # ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          env:
            - name: LINKERD_DISABLED
              value: "Linkerd is disabled ;("
          # ...
```
